Themes are what makes a program usable to the end user. A good theme will make the user
enjoy a program not simply from a usability standpoint but also form an aesthetic
standpoint. Allowing them to both enjoy the results of their actions and the action
itself. Moreover, themes and their aesthetics can draw differing user bases. A program
with a strong material aesthetic will doubtless draw newer users, though it may ultimately
turn away those who prefer a more technical aesthetic.

Themes thus are important.

However, to be a good theme a theme must not simply look good, it must also meet a complex
web of usability requirements for the end user. Themes must not cause excessive eye strain
but they must also have contrasting colors to identify different items. Themes must also
be consistent, with similar colors denoting similar actions. Furthermore themes must not
stand out too much; A theme should, in practical applications not devoted to the aesthetic
contemplation of the theme, follow the principle of least astonishment.

Which brings us to the [Solarized theme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/).

Solarized is an amazing theme. It is low contrast and widely supported by apps hopeless
nerds like me love to use. It also nice in that it reduces eye stain for users by being a
low contrast color scheme, making it easier to spend untold hours in front of a computer.

It is a really nice color scheme and I would highly recommend that you check it out as it
satisfies pretty much every requirement listed above (with the right configuration).

However there are just two, really minor problems with it.
0. It is really, really obvious when contrasted with other dark themes.
1. It's dark theme is blue. Blue tends to cause issues with insomnia.

Problem 0 can be fixed by manually making your own themes for everything. After all,
everyone has tons of time to burn making themes for their favorite applications that
do not already support Solarized color schemes. Likewise everyone uses only open source
applications that can have color schemes added to them by the end user.

Problem 1 can be fixed by simply never using your dark themed computer at night and only
using the light theme then. After all, night is always the brightest time of the day and
thus eye strain should be minimal.

Gruvbox on the other hand is honestly a better color scheme in that respect. It has an
overall more consistent design when mixed with other dark color schemes and generally
lacks the harsh blue tint of everything in the Solarized theme.

Now again, Solarized is a wonderful color scheme and I love it dearly- so much as it is
not the color scheme I use daily on my computer.
