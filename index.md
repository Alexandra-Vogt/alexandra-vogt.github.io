## Lasciate ogni speranza

…a rough description of the thought that comes to the mind of any sapient organism upon 
entering any assembly language class for the first time. It is not an inaccurate thought, 
though I would say that, once the shackles of hope and sanity have been abandoned 
completely assembly can be elegant, beautiful even. Certainly it is worthy as a subject
of aesthetic contemplation. Hence this blog.

This blog will also serve to discuss other topics than the aesthetics of assembly language
so those of us who are particularly faint of heart may also read the blog. My goal is to 
update it daily, though that unfortunately may not always be possible.
