## Lasciate ogni speranza

...a rough description of the thought that comes to the mind of any sapient organism upon 
entering any assembly language class for the first time. It is not an inaccurate thought, 
though I would argue that, once the shackles of hope and sanity have been abandoned
assembly can be elegant, beautiful even. Certainly it is worthy as a subject of aesthetic
contemplation. Hence this blog.

This blog will also serve to discuss other topics than the aesthetics of assembly language
so those of us who are particularly faint of heart do not have to fear. My goal is to update
it daily, though that unfortunately may not always be possible.
