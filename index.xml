      <description>Assembly, Lisp, and Turing Machines I am sometimes overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of a concept in computer science to such a degree that I am moved to tears at points. To be totally honest it is probably this reaction to the beauty of computer science that makes me love learning more than any sort of pretense of productivity (though that matters too).
